# Installing the dependencies

- npm install (installs the dependencies)

# Deploying Smart Contract

- npm run compile (compiles the smart contracts)
- npm run test (run tests)
- npm run node (runs local blockchain)
- npm run deploy (deploys the smart contracts)

After deploying the smart contracts paste the deployment address of NFT.sol smart contract and NFTMarket.sol smart contract in the env.js file.

Since Pinata is used for IPFS, the Pinata Gateway URL, Pinata Gateway Key and the Pinata API Key also needs to be updated in the env.js file.

# Running Front-End

- npm run dev (runs frontend server)
